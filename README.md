# Boggle---CS106B

Assignment 4 from Stanford's programming abstraction .

Project specification : https://see.stanford.edu/materials/icspacs106b/H22-Assign4Boggle.pdf

Stanford's official demo program is available under the sampleApp file 

My notes :

In this stanford classic boggle game , I practiced with recursion and backtracing.  My implementation is different from 
the official demo in that my program briefly highlights each wordformation on board.
